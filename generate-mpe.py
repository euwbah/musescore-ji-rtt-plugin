"""
Converts the exported .mid.csv file into MPE (MIDI Polyphonic Expression) .mid files.

Creates one file per part.

Before you can run this, you need to install MIDIUtil from pip (Python's package manager).

Windows: `py -m pip install MIDIUtil`

Others: `python3 -m pip install MIDIUtil`

How to use: `python3 generate-mpe.py <path-to-file.mid.csv>`
